# U.S. Accident Data Analysis Project

**Tools & Technologies**: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Data Analysis Toolpak), Power QueryðŸ’»ðŸ’»

_The U.S. Accident Data Analysis Project is a data analysis project that involves examining a dataset containing records of accidents that occurred in the United States. The goal of the project is to extract insights, identify patterns, and provide recommendations based on the data. Typically, the dataset includes information about the time, location, severity, and conditions surrounding each accident, such as weather and road conditions._

1.Analyzed a large dataset of U.S. road accidents using Excel, identifying trends related to accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors.

2.Utilized Pivot Tables and Charts to visualize accident patterns, such as peak occurrences during rush hours and adverse weather conditions.

3.Applied statistical analysis using Excelâ€™s Data Analysis Toolpak to uncover correlations between road conditions, driver behavior (speeding, distracted driving), and accident severity.

4.Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query, enhancing data quality and accuracy of insights.
Generated detailed reports and dashboards to visualize accident hotspots and recommended traffic safety improvements.

The findings from analyzing a U.S. accident dataset reveal critical insights into accident trends, causes, and potential prevention measures. Here are some key findings:

1._Accident Severity_
Factors Influencing Severity:
Accidents involving larger vehicles (e.g., trucks, buses) tend to result in more severe outcomes, especially for occupants of smaller vehicles.

2._Road and Traffic Factors_
Highway vs. Local Roads:
Accidents on highways are less frequent but more severe due to higher speeds.
Local roads or streets have frequent minor accidents, often at intersections or near traffic signals.
Road Surface Conditions:
Wet, icy, or snowy road surfaces contribute to a noticeable increase in both accident rates and severity.

3._Weather Conditions_
Impact of Weather on Accident Frequency and Severity:
Rainy or snowy conditions significantly increase accident rates, often with higher severity, particularly in areas unaccustomed to such weather 
Clear weather still account for the highest number of accidents due to more frequent driving but with relatively lower severity compared to poor weather conditions

4._Geographical and Location-Based Insights_
Urban vs. Rural Accidents:
Rural areas show fewer accidents but with higher severity due to higher speeds and delayed emergency response times.
Urban areas tend to have more frequent but less severe accidents because of congestion and lower speed limits.

5._Time-Based Trends_
Peak Accident Times:
Seasonal variations show an increase in accidents during winter months due to snow and icy road conditions and in wet season due to slippery roads.
